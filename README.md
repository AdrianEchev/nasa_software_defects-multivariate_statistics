# nasa_software_defects-multivariate_statistics
NASA shared an interesting dataset which contains characteristics of their softwares and whether they are defective or good. Join me and discover how simple multivariate statistics can help us train a Logistic Regression with optimal conditions!

Note that this project is pretty basic. There are many multivariate statistic techniques in ordeer to get better results from the algorithm. Do you have what it takes to find those strategies?
